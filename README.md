___________________________________________________________________________
**Disclaimer**

Lynx is a tool to modify the data of Inazuma Eleven Go Light or Shadow.  
The tool doesn't work on Chrono Stone or Galaxy, I don't intend to add support for these games.  

**What is a Game Editor?**

Lynx is a Game Editor, you shouldn't confuse a Save Editor with a Game Editor.  
- Save editor: is a tool that reads a save and modifies the data in the save (e.g add player in your party, raise the level of your player). If you pass your save to someone, the guy will have acces to the change you made on your save.
- Game Editor: is a tool that reads the game data and can modify some data (e.g player element, player position, player stat, ...). If you modify your game, only you can see the modified data, if you pass your save to someone, the guy will haven't acces to your modified data, to have acces to your modified data you have to pass him your game file (not your save)

**What is the project?**

The goal of the Lynx project is to develop a tool that makes modding more accessible  
for beginners and experts by unifying various tools in a single application.  
The Tool is written in C# and the project is Open Source, everyone can contribute.

**Supported Features**
- Charabase Editor
